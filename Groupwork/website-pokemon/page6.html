            <h3><p style="color:#ffffff">Totodile is a bipedal, crocodilian Pok√©mon with well-developed jaws. It has red eyes with ridges above them, black markings around its eyes, and several sharp teeth. Totodile tends to be playful by nature and has a habit of biting anything it sees, including its Trainer. However, its jaws are capable of crushing anything, so it sometimes causes serious injuries.</p></h3>
