            <h3><p style="color:#ffffff">Cyndaquil is a small, bipedal Pok√©mon with bluish fur on top of its body and cream-colored fur on its underside. On its back are four red circles that can erupt into flames. When the flames are burning, its back seems to be covered in spines. Cyndaquil is capable of defending itself using these flames, and the fire grows more powerful as it becomes angry or defensive. However, if it is tired, the flames are not able to burn properly.</p></h3>
